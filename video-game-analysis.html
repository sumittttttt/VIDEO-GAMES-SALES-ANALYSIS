      <h2 class='title-content'>Introduction</h2>
      <p class='content'>In this project, I analyze sales data from 16K video games from year 1980 to 2020, analysed some of the major factors like Global Sales, compared sales of two major continents i.e, North America vs Europe, total no. of games in each genre and many things.
</p>


      <h3 class='title-content'>Dataset & Tools</h3>
      <h5 class='title-content'>Dataset:</h5>
      <p class='content'>Dataset is taken from <a class='content'href="https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/mlcourse?select=video_games_sales.csv">Kaggle.
      </a>
      </p>
      <p class='content'>This is the data of video games sales from year 1980 to 2020</p>
      <h5 class='title-content'>Tools:</h5>
      <p class='content'>
        <ol class='content'>
          <li class='content'>Pandas (Python library)</li>
          <p class='content'>This python library helps us to view and manipulate our dataset. </p>
          <li class='content'>Matplotlib Pyplot (Python Library)</li>
          <p class='content'>This helps us to plot our simple and beautiful plots from given dataset.</p>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h3 class='title-content'>Data Analysis</h3>

      <ol class='title-content'>
        <li class='title-content'><h5 class='title-content'>Number of games in each genre</h5></li>
        <p class='content'>First of all, Let's see how many games are there in each genre.</p>
        <img src="genre.png" class='img-fluid image' alt="Oops, not loading try again !" width=1000>
        <p class='content'>So we can see that with the help of this graph that most of the games are there in <b>action</b> genre followed by <b>sports</b> and then <b>miscellaneous</b> and then least number of games are in <b>puzzle</b>, <b>strategy</b> and <b>fighting</b>.
          In numbers we can say that there is around 2350 games in sports genre, 850 games in platform, 1250 games in racing, 1500 games in RPG(Role-Playing games), 580 games in puzzle, 1750 games in miscellaneous, 1300 games in shooter, 870 games in simulation, 3350 games in action, 850 games in fighting, 1300 games in adventure, 700 games in strategy and 2 games in extras ( the number is so small that's why we can't see in our plot ).
        </p>

        <li class='title-content'><h5 class='title-content '>Number of video games released per year</h5></li>
        <p class='content'>Now let's see number of video games released from year 1980 to 2020.</p>
        <img src="no-of-video-games-released.png" class='img-fluid image' alt="Oops, not loading try again ! " width=1000>
        <p class='content'>As we can see in the year 2008 to 2011 most games have been released. But in later years it drastically changes to less than 100 video games released per year, maybe it decreases because of the increase in mobile games and pc/console games. </p>


        <li class='title-content'><h5 class='title-content'>North America VS Europe sales</h5></li>
        <p class='content'>Now let's see the video games sales between two major continents i.e, Europe and North America
          from year to 1980 to 2020.</p>
        <img src="eusales-nasales.png" class='img-fluid image' alt="Oops, not loading try again !" width=1000>
        <p class='content'>After analyzing this plot we can surely say that North America purely dominates Europe in video game sales. In the year 2006, it was around 42 million video game sales and in Europe, it was 28 million.  As we already conclude that in later years the number of video games released has been decreased because of increase in mobile and pc/console games, it also affected the sales in this major continents. But we can surely say that it was very popular in the early years i.e, from 1984 to 2005.</p>

        <li class='title-content'><h5 class='title-content'>Global sales</h5></li>
        <p class='content'>Now let's see global video game sales from year 1980 to 2020</p>
        <img src="global-sales.png"  class='img-fluid image' alt="Oops, not loading try again !" width=1000>
        <p class='content'>Not surprised that there were huge video game sales in the year 2006 around 83 million globally, and it decreased in later years. </p>

        <li class='title-content'><h5 class='title-content'>Global sales in each genre</h5></li>
        <p class='content'>Now let's take a look at the final plot i.e, Global sales in each genre from the year 1980 to 2020</p>
        <img src="global-sales-genre.png" alt="Oops failed to load !" class='img-fluid image' width=1000>
        <p class='content'>Who doesn't love sports, yeah everyone loves that and this is no different for video games. So that's why it was around 82 million video game sales globally followed by platform and racing. It was quite low in strategy and adventure video games.</p>
      </ol>

      <h3 class='title-content'>The End</h3>
